# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Moukhtar Zoubairov

_Currently studying computer science at the University of Toulouse._

I've always loved programming and learning how different types of machines work. I knew right away that my dream job would be in the field of computer science, and it is, as I want to become a Software engineer.
**I love working out things by myself and trying out all sorts of things !**
